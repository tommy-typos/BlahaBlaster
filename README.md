## Brief description of the game

The game is played on a 2-dimensional field, consisting of square-shaped tiles. The game is played by 2 players, each controlling a Bomberman character with the goal of being the last one standing. The game field contains wall elements, boxes, monsters, and the playersâ€™ characters. Players can place bombs to blow up boxes, monsters, and players (including themselves). A player loses (and thus their opponent wins) if they explode or are caught by a monster.
